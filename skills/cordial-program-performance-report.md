description: Build a Cordial-branded, exec-ready report on a whole program's send performance over a period — sends, engagement, and revenue broken down by channel, promotional vs transactional, and batch vs automated, with WoW/MoM/YoY comparison. Use when a marketer/CSM asks to "analyze our whole program's campaign performance and give me a branded report," wants a QBR / exec dashboard for the account, asks "how is our email/SMS/push program performing this month vs last," or to "break down sends and revenue by channel" or "compare channel performance."

# Program Performance Report

Help a marketer or CSM see the whole program's send performance over a defined period — by channel, promo vs transactional, batch vs automated, with revenue — as a clean Cordial-branded artifact they can hand to an exec.

> Shared mechanics live in `reference/`: query grammar + traps in `audience-query-mechanics.md`; tool-traversal patterns (incl. **windowable-vs-lifetime sources** and the **suspicious-result law**) in `tool-ergonomics.md`; the bucket/role/handoff-key map in `tool-index.md`; the **object graph** (batch vs automated vs journey-node messages; child-send row shapes) in `entity-model.md`; the brand spec for the rendered output in `cordial-brand.md`. **Open and read the referenced `reference/` files before building any query — they are required, not optional (do not work from the SKILL body alone).** This recipe only adds what's specific to program-level rollup.

## The linked path

This recipe spans **Account context → Messages (batch + automated) → Performance → Render**. The connective keys are **channel key → messageID**, every figure scoped to a **date window** and grouped on **channelType / classification / type**.

1. **Orient.** `whoami` to confirm the account. **Clarify the date window** with the marketer (and the comparison basis: WoW / MoM / YoY) — program reporting is only accurate when scoped.
2. **Discover channels.** `list_channel_types` → the set of channels that actually exist in this account `{key, name, type}`. Group only by what's there; never assume a channel is configured. **A logical channel is not its key.** Group by `type`, not by guessed key names: one logical channel can span multiple keys (e.g. promo `sms` + `sms-txn` both roll up to "SMS"), and a channel can live under a brand-named key (e.g. push under a brand-named key rather than a literal `push`). Map keys → logical channel via the returned `type` before rolling up. Handoff key = **channel key** (feeds `list_messages.channel` and `get_message_performance.channel`).
3. **Build the windowed rollup.** `list_messages(type=batch)` **and** `list_messages(type=automated)` → per-message inline stats (flat: `sent / opens / clicks / bounced / failures / optOuts / frequencyCapped`) plus `channelType`, `classification`, `name`, `tags`, and (batch only) `sentAt`. **Sort-key trap: the list is often ordered by `updatedAt`, not `sentAt`** — a recently-edited old message can surface on page 1, so you **cannot** bound the window by page position. Scan and filter **every** page on `sentAt` across the recent-update span; never stop paging just because a page's first row looks out-of-window (see Limits for the budget). Then group by week/channel/classification/type. Handoff key = message **id**.
4. **Add revenue + bot-adjusted engagement.** Inline stats carry **no revenue**. For the messages that matter, `get_message_performance(messageId, channel)` → nested `stats` with `revenue / orders / opensAdjusted / clicksAdjusted`; `explain_message_performance` for human-vs-bot and A/B detail. These are **LIFETIME**, not the window — label them as such, never fold them into the windowed totals.
5. **Optional native period engine.** `list_saved_reports` → `run_saved_report(id)` gives windowed revenue + adjusted stats for batch+automated together **but only for the saved report's stored window** (read-only can't re-window it). `list_insight_reports` / `compare_insight_reports` give WoW/period deltas (rate-based, promo email only). Use whichever the account actually supports; reconcile, don't double-count.
6. **Render.** Hand the reconciled rollup to a branded HTML/PPTX exec report using the brand tokens in `reference/cordial-brand.md` (Cheery must appear; Aqua primary; Horizon as text-only section titles).

## Output

A Cordial-branded exec report (HTML or PPTX): program totals + a channel / promo-vs-txn / batch-vs-automated breakdown for the window, with the chosen comparison (WoW/MoM/YoY) and a revenue line. State the window and comparison basis on the asset. Mark every revenue figure sourced from `get_message_performance` as **lifetime**, and label opens as bot-adjusted wherever adjusted columns are used.

## Guardrails

- Read-only. Never imply a report or board was created, saved, or refreshed — all figures are live estimates.
- **Lifetime ≠ window.** Per-message revenue/orders from `get_message_performance`/`explain` are lifetime; never present them as the requested period.
- **Opens are bot-inflated** (MPP). Use `opensAdjusted` / `clicksAdjusted` and say so; raw opens are vanity.
- **Engagement is not apples-to-apples across channels** — don't render one "open rate" column. **Email:** adjusted open/click rate (MPP). **SMS:** opens are always `0`; engagement = clicks (and failure rate). **Push:** the `opens` field is tiny delivery/open-receipts, not comparable to email opens, and clicks are often untracked (`0`) — report **sends-only** for push and say opens/clicks aren't covered. Use channel-specific engagement metrics, not a shared rate.
- **Promo-vs-txn / segment slices depend on coverage.** They rely on per-message `classification` plus tag/naming-convention coverage. If tags are sparse, lean on name-convention prefixes and report a tag-coverage caveat (a tag-coverage audit is the prereq for a fine slice). Report an explicit "unclassified" slice rather than faking completeness.
- Apply the **suspicious-result law** (`tool-ergonomics.md`): if a total doesn't reconcile, find the right traversal before reporting.

## Honest tool limits (what the probe found)

- **No single windowed-revenue rail for all sends.** `list_messages` inline stats have no revenue. Revenue comes either per-message via `get_message_performance` (**lifetime, not windowed**) or via `run_saved_report` rows (windowed **but** locked to the saved report's stored start/end — the read-only rail cannot create or re-window a saved report). If no saved report's stored window matches the requested period, **windowed revenue is a hard gap on that account** — not an edge case. Set this expectation up front: when "revenue by channel" is the headline ask, probe attribution early (one `get_message_performance` on a flagship send) — if `revenue`/`orders` come back `0`/null, the deliverable degrades to **order-rate proxies** (from the insight engine) only, with no dollar figure. Say so before promising a revenue line.
- **Automated sends can't be date-windowed from `list_messages` alone** — automated messages carry no `sentAt` and their inline stats are lifetime-cumulative. Window them via a `type:both` saved report whose window matches. If the only saved report is mis-windowed and the insight engine is promo-email-only (common), automated sends **cannot be windowed at all** on that account — then the batch-vs-automated breakdown is necessarily batch=windowed / automated=lifetime-only. Call out that apples-to-oranges split explicitly rather than presenting them as one period.
- **Insight engine is promotional-email-only, rate-based, fixed rolling 14-day (Sun–Sat) windows** — not calendar MoM, and it reports open/click/order-rate means + ranges (and WoW deltas), no absolute send/revenue totals; revenue-per-email can return "none" where attribution is sparse.
- **Massive pagination + unsafe page-bounding.** Message lists run to thousands of pages (a test account showed tens of thousands of batch messages). Because the list is often sorted by `updatedAt` not `sentAt` (step 3), you cannot stop at the page where `sentAt` "crosses" the window — out-of-window-but-recently-updated rows are interleaved. Use a larger `perPage` (e.g. 100), set an explicit page budget, and scan/filter each page on `sentAt` across the recent-update span; if the budget can't cover the window deterministically, say so rather than under-counting a calendar rollup.
- **Re-fetch ids live.** Always pull message ids from a fresh `list_messages` call; never reuse a cached/probe id (ids drift — a stale automated id won't match the live one).
- **`export_message_stats` is an export action, outside the read-only rail** — use `get_message_performance` / `run_saved_report` (get) for per-message revenue instead.
- **Group only by channels that exist.** Cross-channel comparisons like RCS-vs-SMS work only where that channel is configured (discovered via `list_channel_types`). If a channel isn't in the account, the comparison isn't possible there — say so rather than implying it.
- Report at the level the tools support; never infer hidden internals (e.g. the exact bot/MPP model or attribution logic — defer to Cordial's definition).

## Worked example (illustrative — fictional values)

A marketer asks: *"How did email vs SMS vs push perform last month vs the month before — sends, engagement, and revenue — as an exec report?"*

`whoami` confirms the account; window set to last month vs prior month (MoM). `list_channel_types` → `email`, `sms`, `push` exist (no RCS, so it's excluded). `list_messages(type=batch)` + `list_messages(type=automated)`, filtered on `sentAt` to the two months, roll up to (illustrative):

| Channel | Sends (last mo) | Adj. open rate | MoM sends |
|---|---|---|---|
| Email | 4,200,000 | 22% | +6% |
| SMS | 310,000 | n/a | −3% |
| Push | 880,000 | 11% | +14% |

Promo vs transactional split via `classification` + name-convention prefixes (e.g. a `NL_` newsletter prefix = promo, a `TR_` prefix = transactional). For the top promo sends, `get_message_performance` adds a **lifetime** revenue line (labeled lifetime, e.g. ~$1.2M direct on the flagship newsletter, opens adjusted from ~277k raw to ~33k human). Rendered to a branded one-pager per `cordial-brand.md`. All numbers above are fictional and for shape only.

## Inlined shared mechanics — read and follow these; do not skip
_(These are the shared references this skill depends on, flattened in so they are never skipped. Deeper traversal patterns, if referenced, are bundled under `reference/`.)_

### Tool index (buckets, roles, handoff keys)

Reference map shared by all recipes. Three lenses: **buckets** (what), **role tags** (when), **handoff keys** (how they link). All tools are read-only.

## Role tags

Every tool plays a repeatable role in a chain. Recipes reference these roles so they survive tool changes.

| Role | Purpose | Needs an ID first? |
|---|---|---|
| **Orient** | Establish account context | No |
| **Discover/List** | Find the thing; returns IDs + names | No |
| **Inspect/Get** | Drill into one entity by ID | Yes |
| **Expand** | Fan out from an entity to its children | Yes |
| **Reference/Example** | Show a correct pattern before building | No |
| **Analyze/Terminal** | The payoff call that produces the answer | Usually |

Typical flow: **Orient → Discover → Inspect → Expand → Analyze**, with Reference as a side-trip before constructing any query.

## The 8 buckets

**1. Session & Account Context** — `whoami`(Orient) · `get_account_overview`/`_document` · `get_recent_account_activity` · `describe_contact_schema` · `describe_account_events` · `get_account_products_config` · `list_channel_types`

**2. Audiences & Segmentation** — `list_audiences`(Discover) · `get_audience`(Inspect) · `get_audience_count` · `describe_audience` · `estimate_audience`(Terminal) · `get_audience_health` · `get_audience_trends` · `get_account_audience_samples`(Reference) · `search_audience_examples`(Reference)

**3. Messages & Sends** — `list_messages`(Discover) · `get_message`(Inspect) · `get_message_transport` · `list_message_transports` · `list_child_sends`(Expand) · `get_message_report`

**4. Performance & Reporting** — `get_message_performance`(Terminal) · `explain_message_performance` · `export_message_stats` · `list_insight_reports` · `get_insight_report` · `compare_insight_reports` · `list_saved_reports` · `run_saved_report` · `describe_report_entities` · `describe_report_export_columns`

**5. Orchestrations / Journeys** — `list_orchestrations`(Discover) · `get_orchestration`(Inspect) · `search_orchestration_examples`(Reference)

**6. Data Tables & Supplements** — `get_account_supplements` · `list_supplements` · `get_supplement` · `list_supplement_records`(Expand) · `list_data_batches` · `get_data_batch` · `list_data_automations` · `get_data_automation`

**7. Content & Creative** — `list_sculpt_templates`/`get_sculpt_template` · `list_sculpt_blocks`/`get_sculpt_block` · `list_html_includes`/`get_html_include` · `search_images`/`get_image` · `list_tags`/`get_tag`

**8. Product Catalog** — `list_products` · `get_product`

## Handoff keys (the connective tissue)

| Key | Produced by | Consumed by |
|---|---|---|
| **attribute/field names** | `describe_contact_schema` | audience criteria in `estimate_audience`, `get_audience_count` |
| **audienceID** | `list_audiences` | `get_audience`, `get_audience_health`, `estimate_audience` |
| **orchestrationID** | `list_orchestrations` | `get_orchestration` → `list_child_sends` |
| **messageID** | `list_child_sends`, `list_messages` | `get_message_performance`, `export_message_stats` |
| **date range** | (user intent) | cross-cutting filter on all reporting tools |

## Always start with `whoami`

The user may have switched accounts since last login. Confirm the account before any chain.

### Query grammar & traps

Account-agnostic *how-to* for any recipe that touches `estimate_audience` / audience criteria. This file is the **mechanism**; the real **values** are always learned live from the account (never hardcode them here).

## The self-learning loop

For any attribute, learn the account before querying it:

1. **Find it** — `describe_contact_schema` (contact attributes: `key` + `type`) or `describe_account_events` (behavioral). The **type drives the wrapper**.
2. **Learn real values + operators** — `search_audience_examples` (natural-language) and/or `get_account_audience_samples`. Read the returned live query JSON and lift the actual values, operator, and wrapper. These examples are the source of truth.
3. **Fallback when examples don't cover it** (common for `crdl_ai_*` and other unused attributes) — probe empirically with `estimate_audience` (see completeness check below).
4. **Size** — `estimate_audience` with the learned attribute + operator + value(s).

## Grammar notes (verify against live examples — these can vary by account)

- **Wrapper by type:** string → `icfs`, number → `icfn`, date → `icfd`, **array → `icfa`**, geo → `geoRange`. Don't put a numeric field under `icfs`. Arrays expose a `has_value` operator (`{"icfa":{"<key>":{"operator":"has_value"}}}`) — use it for "has any value" coverage rather than excluding `is_empty`.
- **Conditions** always nest under `and` / `or`. Negation goes under an `exclude` block — **but `exclude` needs a base to subtract from.** A top-level `exclude` with no `and`/`or` base returns `count: 0` (a silent-zero variant), not the complement. Pair it with a base: `{"and": [ … ], "exclude": { "or": [ … ] }}`.
- **Universal base / file total:** an **empty `and`** — `{"and": []}` — returns the entire contact file count. Use it as the denominator for account-wide coverage and as the base for a deterministic exclusion residual (`{"and": [], "exclude": {"or": […]}}`).
- **"Is set"** = `is_empty` *negated* (there is no `exists` / `set` / `not_empty` operator).
- **Operators seen in the wild:** `matches`, `in`, `gt` / `lt`, `after`, `is_empty`, `has_domain`, `begins_with`. Subscription state via `channels.email.ss matches ["s"|"u"|"n"]`; validity via `isInvalid` / `isNotInvalid`.
- **The canonical subscribed-state clause, written out in full** (the single most-asked clause; both key notations shown because examples display the comma form while `estimate_audience` usually wants dots — if one silent-zeros, flip to the other):
  - As `search_audience_examples` displays it (comma form): `{"channels":{"channels,email,ss":{"operator":"matches","value":["s"]}}}` — this form can silently return 0 through `estimate_audience`.
  - Converted (the form that worked live): `{"and":[{"channels":{"channels.email.ss":{"operator":"matches","value":["s"]}}}]}` — keep the outer `channels` wrapper object, dot only the inner key.
  - "Emailable" is stricter than "subscribed": saved audiences routinely AND `isNotInvalid: email` onto the `ss` clause — state which definition you used; offer the other as a follow-up.
  - Searching for ss grammar: query status wording ("subscription status subscribed opted in"), not "subscribed to email" — the latter semantically matches subscribe-DATE band audiences instead.
- **`search_audience_examples` payloads can be huge** (>100KB on one line at limit 8) — use a small `limit` (≤5) and re-query rather than one broad pull.
- **`saved_audience` clause works in `estimate_audience`** ◐: criteria lifted from an orchestration fork/filter can reference `{"saved_audience":{"id":"…"}}` — that clause can be fed back to `estimate_audience` as-is to size the referenced audience (confirmed live once).
- **Sibling-attribute value donation:** when the target attribute has no audience example, lift candidate values/casing from a *same-domain sibling* that does (a loyalty-status example donates tier-value candidates for a tier-level field; `tracking_AI_*_High` audiences donate lowercase `high` for an unexampled `crdl_ai_*` dim) — then verify via the residual check before reporting.
- **Geo fields** use a dedicated `geoRange` wrapper for radius targeting: `{"geoRange":{"geo_location":{"distance":15,"operator":"within","units":"mi","location":{"postal_code":"78748"}}}}`. Common geo fields: `geo_location`, `auto_locate_geo`. (Store-level targeting is often an `or` of `home_store matches "<store#>"` plus a `geoRange` around the store's ZIP.)
- **Channel-scoped subscribe/unsubscribe date bands** (`subscribedDate` / `unsubscribedDate`): these are **top-level clause keys** carrying a `channel` (e.g. `"email"`), **NOT** `icfd` and **NOT** contact attributes — they will not appear in `describe_contact_schema`. They are the date-windowable source for subscribe/unsubscribe *flow* (no 12-month ceiling). **Two grammar shapes exist and which one works varies by account — learn the live one from `search_audience_examples` before banding:**
  - **Two-clause `after`/`before`, `AND`ed** (one observed working form): a month `[start, nextStart)` = `{"and":[{"subscribedDate":{"operator":"after","channel":"email","value":"2025-01-01"}},{"subscribedDate":{"operator":"before","channel":"email","value":"2025-02-01"}}]}`. (Some accounts band the upper bound via an `exclude` on the next-month clause instead — same `[start,nextStart)` result.)
  - **Single `between` with a `{gte,lt}` value object** (other observed working form): `{"subscribedDate":{"operator":"between","channel":"email","value":{"gte":"2025-01-01","lt":"2025-02-01"}}}`.
  - **Silent-zero traps (all returned `0`, no error):** nested-path shapes (`{"channels":{"email":{"subscribedDate":{...}}}}`), `between` with a date *array* instead of a `{gte,lt}` object, and (on the account where `after`/`before` was the working form) `between` was unsupported entirely. If a band returns 0, fire the universal-base control, then try the *other* grammar shape — don't read it as "no subscribes that month."

## Two traps to always respect

- **Silent zero.** Invalid operators *and* wrong values both return `count: 0` with no error. A zero means "re-check the operator/value against a real example," not "no data." When in doubt, fire one known-good control query first to confirm the tool is returning live numbers.
- **Enumerate values by progressive exclusion (deterministic).** With no distinct-values endpoint, don't sum guessed values additively. Instead peel known values off and measure the exact remainder: estimate against a real base while `exclude`-ing `is_empty` plus every value found so far — `{"and": [], "exclude": { "or": [ {…is_empty}, {…=v1}, {…=v2} ] }}` (the empty `and` base is required; a bare `exclude` returns 0). When the residual hits ~0 you've found them all; while it's large, add one more candidate and re-measure. **Cap the effort** — these are free-form strings and can be high-cardinality, so capture the meaningful buckets + a deterministic "other" remainder rather than enumerating exhaustively.
- **Distinguish "no value" from "unnamed value."** `is_empty` catches truly-unset fields (often a small slice). A large residual that survives excluding `is_empty` *and* all known values is a **real, non-empty value you haven't named yet** — not null. For Cordial AI `*_category` / `*_string` fields this is almost always the **`no <activity>` bucket** (`no engagement`, `no purchase`); probe that and the residual closes to 0. (Observed: `crdl_ai_engagement_momentum` → `no engagement`; `crdl_ai_average_order_value_category` → `no purchase`, residual hit exactly 0.) Report "no value" and any named bucket separately.

## Coverage idioms

- **Has any value (strings/numbers).** If the account supports a direct `has_value` operator on the field (`{"and":[{"icfs":{"<key>":{"operator":"has_value"}}}]}` — confirm it's real via `search_audience_examples`, don't assume), that's the **simplest primary**. Otherwise (and always as the cross-check) use the **arithmetic residual:** `populated = file_total − direct is_empty(missing)` — fire `{"and":[]}` for the file total and `{"and":[{…is_empty}]}` for the missing count, then subtract. The residual is the **most robust** fallback and self-reconciles (missing + populated must equal file total); a direct `has_value` result that does *not* equal `file_total − is_empty` is a silent-zero/grammar smell — re-check.
- **Has any value via complement — use only as a cross-check, and verify it reconciles.** The complement forms (`{"and":[],"exclude":{"or":[{…is_empty}]}}`, a `{"not":[{…is_empty}]}` wrapper, or an `is_not_empty` operator) are **unreliable on some accounts**: they have been observed silently returning `0`, or **echoing the same value as the direct `is_empty` count** (so populated == missing, summing to ~2× the file). Treat any populated query whose result *equals the `is_empty` count* as suspicious-by-definition and fall back to the `file_total − is_empty` arithmetic. Do **not** put `is_empty` as a positive `and`-member to mean "has value" (a non-empty base `{"and":[{…is_empty}]}` was observed returning `0`).
- **`is_empty` itself can be non-functional on strings.** On some accounts `is_empty:true`, `is_empty:false`, and `not(is_empty:true)` all return `0` for a string dim. When `is_empty` returns 0 but you have other evidence the dim is populated (e.g. positive `in [v1,v2,…]` matches), do not report 0 missing — derive coverage from enumerated-value `in` matches and treat `file_total − populated` as the residual. `not` is **not** a reliable set-complement here either: `not(field in [v1,v2,v3])` has been observed returning the *same* count as the positive `in` match, not the complement.
- **Missing:** the `is_empty` clause directly — **when it works** (see above). Cross-check it reconciles against `file_total − populated`.
- **Distribution:** estimate each value (or `in` a set).
- **Within an audience:** `AND` the attribute clause onto the base audience's criteria.

## Content references (for usage scans)

Attributes appear in message/block content as **Smarty tokens**: `{$contact.<attribute_key>}` (e.g. `{$contact.digital_giftcard_pin}`). Supplements and other data use similar `{$...}` vars. Reusable content is pulled in via `{include 'content:<key>'}`. To find where an attribute is already used, fetch content (`get_sculpt_block`, `get_html_include` — prefer the `key` arg, `get_sculpt_template`, `get_message`) and search for `{$contact.<key>}`.

**Where attributes/content get used, by source:**
- Sculpt blocks / templates, HTML includes → `{$contact.<key>}` and `{include 'content:<key>'}` in content (statically searchable).
- Data automations ("data jobs") → strong signal from name/key/tags; `get_data_automation` exposes trigger **filter criteria** (may reference attributes) + schedule, **but not the inner transformation script** — usage is reportable at job level only.
- Supplements → content sometimes sources from a supplement (data table) instead of a contact attribute (`$utils->getSupplementRecords` with a supplement key, rendering `{$row.<col>}`); note this so usage attribution is accurate. Coupons/gift codes especially are often supplement- or month-rotating-include-driven rather than a static literal.

**Dynamic include binding (blockData) — a static scan blind spot.** Reusable content can be pulled in *dynamically*: a sculpt block whose html is `{include "content:{$blockData.<...>.select_block|default:'<fallback>'}"}` (a "select menu of all HTML Content" widget). The **selected** include key is stored per-message in `blockData` and is **NOT** present in the rendered message HTML — `get_message` exposes only the `|default` fallback. So grepping message bodies for `content:<key>` systematically **misses** these dynamic bindings. Treat any message built on such a block as a *possible* consumer of the target, and flag the per-message selection as an API-unexposed (confirmed-unidentifiable) slice rather than counting it absent.

## Etiquette

- All tools read-only — never imply an audience was built or saved.
- Counts are estimates; say so.
- Transient `MCP server connection lost` happens; retry once.

### Cordial brand tokens (for rendered deliverables)

Self-contained Cordial brand spec for recipes that produce a **deliverable** (HTML report, slides, doc, dashboard). It ships inside this repo so a branded output needs **no external brand skill** — reference this file, apply the tokens, done. This is Cordial's own brand (vendor brand, not client data); applying it consistently is the goal.

> A recipe that only returns numbers/tables in chat does **not** need this. Pull it in only when the outcome is a rendered, shareable artifact.

## Palette (use the hex values verbatim)

| Token | Hex | Use |
|---|---|---|
| **Cheery** (yellow) | `#FABC1C` | **Must appear on every asset** — accent, highlight, key stat, a rule/CTA. Cordial's signature. |
| **Aqua** | `#0DBDF6` | Primary accent — use **most frequently** (charts, bars, highlights). |
| **Pacific** (blue) | `#148EF3` | Links, secondary highlights. |
| **Horizon** (orange) | `#FF833E` | Eyebrows + section titles — as **TEXT only, never a fill/background**. |
| White | `#FFFFFF` | Base background. |
| Sand | `#FCF4ED` | Warm background / section banding. |
| Haze | `#F5F5F5` | Neutral background / cards. |
| Medium Gray | `#EBE8E5` | Borders, dividers, gridlines. |
| Dark Gray | `#474747` | Subtitles, secondary text. |
| Black | `#151515` | Primary text, headers. |

**Frequency rule:** Aqua > Pacific > Horizon. Lead with Aqua; Pacific second; Horizon reserved for eyebrows/section titles. On dark backgrounds, text is white.

**Variance / KPI indicators:** light **green** = positive (`#E3F4E4` fill / `#1F7A33` text), light **yellow** = neutral/flat (`#FCF4ED` / `#8A6D1B`), light **red** = negative (`#FBE6E6` / `#B3261E`). Use for WoW/MoM deltas, pacing, over/under.

## Typography

- **Poppins** — headlines, titles, callouts, statistics.
  - Title: SemiBold (600), 28–34pt, −1% letter-spacing.
  - Subtitle: Medium (500), 18–24pt.
  - **Eyebrow: Bold (700), 12–14pt, ALL CAPS, +0.5% letter-spacing, Horizon `#FF833E`.**
- **Open Sans** — body copy, paragraphs, table cells. Regular (400) or Bold (700), 12–24pt, 120–150% line-height.
- Big numbers (the "so what") in Poppins SemiBold; label them in an Open Sans caption.

Web fonts (when rendering HTML): `Poppins` + `Open Sans` from Google Fonts; fall back to system sans (`-apple-system, Segoe UI, Roboto, sans-serif`).

## Layout idioms for reports

- **Eyebrow → Title → Subtitle** header stack: Horizon eyebrow (ALL CAPS) above a Poppins title, optional Dark Gray subtitle.
- **Section titles** = Horizon **text** (no colored bar behind them).
- **KPI cards**: Haze or white card, Medium-Gray border, big Poppins stat, Open Sans label, a variance chip (green/yellow/red).
- **Charts**: Aqua as the primary series, Pacific as the secondary, Cheery to spotlight one bar/point; gridlines Medium Gray; never use Horizon as a fill.
- **Tables**: header row Black text on Haze, Medium-Gray row separators, right-align numbers.
- Include **one Cheery element per asset** even on data-dense pages (a top rule, a highlighted KPI, the logo lockup).

## Output formats (recipe states which)

- **HTML report** — self-contained `<style>` block using the hexes above + the Google Fonts link. No external CSS dependency.
- **Slides (pptx)** — title slide with eyebrow/title, KPI grid, one chart per slide; brand colors as the theme.
- **Doc (docx)** — Poppins headings, Open Sans body, Horizon section titles, branded cover.

## Do / Don't

### Entity model (the Cordial object graph)

The map of how Cordial's domain objects **relate** and which tool reads each edge. Audience/count questions rarely need this (estimate_audience is self-contained); orchestration / message / experiment / content questions live or die on it. Mechanics and traps stay in `audience-query-mechanics.md` + `tool-ergonomics.md` — this file is the *schema*, not the how-to.

Confidence tags: ✅ = confirmed in ≥2 accounts · ◐ = observed in one account (verify live before relying).

## Experiments — the structure inside the message (field-confirmed live ✅)

Experiments live **on the message**, not on the orchestration. The chain for "how did the test in this journey do":
`list_orchestrations → get_orchestration → composition.actions[] (action.type==="Message") → action.id → get_message_performance(action.id, channelKey) → experiments[]`.

- `experiments[]` is an **array of test ROUNDS**, not one test. Round names **repeat** (an account ran six rounds all named `SLtest`) — distinguish rounds by `created` + `contentKey`, never by name. ✅
- Round object: `name`, `strategy` (e.g. `"mab"`), `conversion` (the winning-metric key, e.g. `uniqueopens`/`uniqueclicks`), `created`, `contentKey` (links the round to a content version — not directly retrievable), `isCurrent` (the active round), `isDraft`, `publishDate`, `variants[]`. ✅
- Variant: `{name (Control/Test1/SLT_1…), stats{…}}`. Stats keys: `ts` (sends), `to`/`uo` (total/unique opens), `tc`/`uc` (clicks), `tb` (bounced), `tr`/`tri` (revenue direct/indirect), `or`/`ori` (orders), `oo` (opt-outs), `cmp` (complaints), plus the conversion key as a **rate**. `ho`/`uho`/`hc`/`uhc` (human/adjusted) populate **only on recent rounds** — fall back to raw ratios when absent and say so. ✅
- **Rounds can be all-zero** (configured/published but never accrued sends) — skip them in reporting, don't average them in. ◐
- **No significance/p-value field exists.** Winner calls are descriptive, with sample sizes. ✅
- MAB (`strategy:"mab"`) reallocates traffic — arm send counts are intentionally unequal; don't read unequal `ts` as a targeting bug. ✅

## Cross-cutting facts that change verdicts

- **Status lives at every layer and they can disagree** ✅ (confirmed in 2 accounts): an *enabled* orchestration routinely points at node messages whose own dashboard `status` is `disabled` — for "is it live," the journey status + recent child-send rows win, not the message status. A *disabled* journey can't have been sending (flips a contact-trace verdict). Read status at the layer the question is about.
- **Opens accrue to the day of the OPEN, not the send** ◐ — small daily child rows can show opens > sends; normal, not corruption. But a daily row with opens **orders of magnitude** above sends (125 sent / 27k opens observed) is a **bot/scanner storm** — exclude it from windowed rates, corroborate via the lifetime total-vs-unique gap.
- **`search_orchestration_examples` can be broken on Production** ◐ (hard 404 `Unknown artifact type: orchestration`, two runs) — treat the full `list_orchestrations` scan as the primary discovery path; the semantic tool is a bonus when it works.
- **Windowable vs lifetime** ✅: only batch `sentAt` and child-send run rows can be date-windowed; message dashboards and `get_message_performance` are lifetime. (Full pattern in `tool-ergonomics.md`.)
- **The three message-id-like keys**: orchestration node `action.id` (= message/template id, chainable), `publishedId` (content hash, NOT chainable), child-send `:rm…`/`:d…` ids (chainable into `get_message_performance` for per-run revenue). Confusing these is the classic dead-end. ✅
